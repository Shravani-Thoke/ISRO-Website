The ISRO said it successfully reduced the orbit of the Chandrayaan-3 mission's Lander Module (LM) on Sunday. Launched on 14 July, the lander module of Chandrayaan-3 successfully separated from the Propulsion Module on Thursday, 35 days after the mission was launched.</span>

            <span class="text-dark">Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed near the moon's south pole on Aug. 23. 2023. at 8:33 a.m. ET (1233 GMT or 6:03 p.m. India Standard Time). The mission is managed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). ISRO's roots go back to the beginning of space exploration, as a predecessor agency was set up in 1962 and its first rocket launch was in 1963. ISRO itself was established in 1969.
            </span>
            <br><br>
            <span class="text-dark">The three main objectives of Chandrayaan-3 are to land safely on the surface, to demonstrate rover operations and to perform scientific experiments on site, according to the official website. The mission called for a propulsion module to ferry the Chandrayaan-3' Vikram ('valor") lander and the solar-powered rover named Pragyan (Sanskrit for 'wisdom") rover together to the south pole of the moon, according to NASA. The module then entered lunar orbit and maneuvered into a roughly circular path about 6o miles (1oo km) above the surface. Then the lander separated from the module and aimed for a soft landing on the surface, achieving this on Aug. 23. 2023.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span class="text-dark">The lander and rover will collect science on the surface for 14 Earth days (a single day on the moon), while the propulsion module will gaze at our planet for its own science experiment. The spacecraft package (rover. lander and propulsion module) includes "advanced technologies" to meet the mission objectives. ISRO says. Examples include hazard detection and avoidance on the rover, a landing leg mechanism to aim for a soft touchdown, and attimeters and velocity instruments to estimate altitude and speed above the moon. ISRO has performed several technology tests to simulate lunar conditions, the agency emphasized, focusing on matters such as soaking instruments in cold temperatures similar to the moon or doing a lander leg test on a simulated surface under different landing conditions.</span>
